1. Introduction/Business Problem
Thousands of foreign nationals troop into Canada every year in search of University education. This is due largely to Canada's 'flexible' immigration policy, quality education, comparative lower tuition and consistent high ranking for overall quality of life. Prospective students are presented with a deluge of options from which to make a choice - no mean fit by any standard, as Canada has a plethora of reputable Univesities across its provinces and territories. It would certainly be helpful if these young and enthusiastic ones were gifted a tool or platform to help, at least, point them in the right direction in their search. 

This project offers a lifeline. Canadian Universites are organized into clusters predicated upon pre-selected attributes(or features). Each cluster comprises Universities having a unique combination of attributes - which we call 'cluster description'. Prospective students can then identify the cluster into which to focus their search based on the accompanying cluster description. Thus the search experience is refined, effective and less time consuming.
